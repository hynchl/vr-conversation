# WebRTC Signaling Server

This Node.js-based signaling server facilitates WebRTC communication. It has the same functionality as the original repository (forwarding offer, answer, and ICE candidate). This version offers a simpler structure compared to the original and includes a feature that keeps track of connected clients (refer to `clients`).

### Usage

1. Installation

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the Server

```bash
node index.js
```

### Notes

- Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system before proceeding.
- For testing, refer to **the example provided in the original repository** [https://github.com/jungdu/rtc-socket-connector-example].
